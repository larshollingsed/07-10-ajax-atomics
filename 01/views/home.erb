<h3>Why are you able to make requests to /info1 and /info2 even though there are no route handlers for those paths defined in app.rb?</h3>
<p>Since there isn't a route path defined in app.rb, sinatra then looks in the public file for something matching "info1" or "info2".</p>

<h3>Why is the XHR object's request path /info1 instead of /public/info1?</h3>
<p>Sinatra defaults to adding "/public" when the path is called.</p>

<h3>Within the addEventListener function, what does this represent?</h3>
<p>In the addEventListener function, "this" refers to the thing that is being "listened" to for an event; in our case, that is our "req" variable.</p>
